# Basic 4-Bit CPU in Verilog

This project is a simple 4-bit CPU designed using Verilog HDL. It includes key components like a basic ALU, control unit, and register file. This CPU supports fundamental operations and can be used as a starting point for understanding processor architecture and RTL design.

## ðŸ§  Features

- 4-bit data path
- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) with basic operations
- Control Unit for instruction decoding
- Register File with multiple registers
- Opcode-based instruction selection
- Clock-driven synchronous operation

## ðŸ§± CPU Components

- **ALU**: Supports basic arithmetic and logic operations (like ADD, SUB, AND, OR)
- **Control Unit**: Decodes opcodes and controls data flow
- **Registers**: Temporary data storage
- **Instruction Set**: Custom 4-bit opcodes for operations

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- Verilog HDL
- Vivado (for simulation and synthesis)

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Vivado or your preferred Verilog IDE
3. Run simulations using the provided testbench
4. Analyze waveforms to verify correct operation
